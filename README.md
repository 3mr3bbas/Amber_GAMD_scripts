- **Example scripts and AMBER MD setup to run GAMD**
```
/a_gamd_md
  - LSF_amber_gamd.XXX-min   [ LSF script to run AMBER GAMD simulation in the initial state, plus 4_gamd_init ]
  - LSF_amber_gamd.XXX-run   [ LSF script to run AMBER GAMD simulation in production state ]
  - rerun_amber.csh          [ rerun a production run from previous restart file with new number ]

- Required packages:
    AMBER       # stable: 16+, nvidia V100 CUDA-enabled
    cpptraj     # github version is better
```
- Contains AMBER scripts to run GAMD simulations. See the LSF scripts within for submission to HPC.


- Example data
```
/b_data
/b_orig_data
```
- Processed Data files of _GAMD Energy_ and _Structural Metrics_. The Energy and Metric files should have **matching number of data points**. 
*/b_orig_data* contains the _original_ dataset, **32,000** data points from 2 trajectories of 320ns GAMD run, taken at _20-ps interval_.
*/b_data* is the strip-down version of */b_orig_data*, **16,000** data points each, taken at _40-ps interval_.

- Example results
```
/c_result
/c_orig_result
```
- _2D heatmaps of free energy and conformational population landscapes image files_. Compare the two sets, you will see the strip-down version has less detail and some of the less-populated states are not shown. 
- This is also an example of the effect of **under-sampling** when generating the result. Recommend to take data from _no less than 20-ps interval and at least 500-ns_ worth of data for short peptide analysis. For larger system with large-scale movement, larger interval would be okay.

- Preparation of the converted **GAMD Energy summary file** from individual raw GAMD Energy files found in _folders/subfolders_. Each raw file has header comments and the initial GAMD file (4_gamd_init) has a row of _0.00000000_ that needs to be removed. This script takes care of that. 
- This script also converts the GAMD energy from eV to kcal/mol at the Temperature used in the simulation, as instructed in the GAMD manual: _prepare_gamd_log.txt_

- This script is the **MAIN** script to summarize _GAMD results into **2D** figures_ of **free energy** and **conformational population** landscapes. It takes the prepared GAMD Energy summary file and Structural Metrics to generate landscape files.
- See the example file: **test_step_2.gamd_2d_generation_data.orig.csh**

**2D energy landscape plot to identify potential energy wells and activation energy barrier sampled in GAMD runs.**

- One key thing about the conformational free energy landscape (measured in potential-of-mean force) is that GAMD has to have accessed that particular conformation in order to get an energy value. If GAMD couldn't sample a particular space, either due to undersampling from "too-short" simulations, or it is energetically inaccessable for GAMD, then there would be a gapping "high-energy" hole in the middle of a low-energy well. In that case, either extend the simulation, or change the size of '-bin' so that with averaging of a different size of group, the missing "hole" can be removed.

![2D energy landscape plot to identify potential energy wells and activation energy barrier sampled in GAMD runs](https://github.com/mungpeter/GAMD_scripts/blob/master/Examples/c_result/2D_dG_surf.fgf21-v16-s2-cp.all-half.204-208.rmsd.dist_s204-w207.dG.png)

**2D Conformational density plot to identify clusters of population actually sampled frequently in GAMD runs.**

- This is a direct representation of the GAMD sampling. In cases where the free-energy minima are accessible in the simulation conditions, the free-energy minima should correspond to the population density. This indicates that the measured region is conformationally well-behaved. However, if the free-energy minima is not really accessible due to either conformational constraints or lowe frequency of accessing due to high entropy, then the free-energy landscape and conformational density plots will be different. This is a tell-tale sign that the measured region has high entropy/flexibility.

- When the x- and y-axis parameters were chosen that correctly reflect the energetically relevant conformational changes, the free-energy landscape (potential-of-mean force plot, above) and conformational population landscape plot (below) would see well defined clusters of population.

- This script counts the _frequency MD frames falling within specified ranges in a 2D landscape_. This is essentially binning to see what is the size of different conformational populations.
